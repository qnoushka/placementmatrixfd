# Campus Placement & Internship Intelligence Platform

A data-driven internal platform designed to help students understand placement and internship trends using historical data — focusing on insights and decision support rather than simple tracking.

> ⚠️ Note: The data used in this project is **simulated and anonymized**. The platform is designed to work with real institutional data in the future.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Most placement portals only answer **“what happened?”**  
This platform focuses on answering:

- What factors historically mattered the most?
- How did CGPA buckets affect selection?
- Which skills were most commonly associated with successful candidates?
- What should a student prioritize next in their preparation?

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard

- CGPA bucket vs selection trends
- Skill-wise selection frequency
- Company and role-based filtering
- Backend-powered analytics with safe fallback to simulated data

### 🔍 Preparation Impact Simulator

- User inputs CGPA and selected skills
- CGPA is mapped to historical buckets
- Visualizes historical selection patterns for similar profiles
- Provides **decision support**, not predictions

> The simulator is intentionally designed to avoid predicting outcomes and instead focuses on explainable, historical insights.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React (Vite)
- Axios
- Reusable visualization components
- React Router

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- RESTful analytics APIs

---

## 🧩 System Design Highlights

- **Mock-data-first development** to enable parallel frontend and backend work
- Clean separation between analytics logic and UI
- Graceful handling of backend latency and downtime
- Reusable components across dashboard and simulator
- Ethics-first design (no false predictions)

## ✅ STEP 3: Quick Self-Check (1 minute)

Ask yourself:
- Can a stranger understand the project in 1–2 minutes?
- Is it clear this is **analytics + intelligence**, not CRUD?
- Does it avoid fake ML claims?

If yes → perfect.
